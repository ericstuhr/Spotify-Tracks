# Spotify-Tracks
mash up of two spotify projects to get tracks from a playlist

#Introduction
This is NOT original code, it is simply a modification of another guide (in order to bypass the limitation on how many tracks can be pulled).

#Installation
To begin, you're going to want to set up a spotify API account, with a good tutorial provided here
https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/quick-start/

You can follow the instructions on installation from the example respository provided by Spotify, which will show you how to
install the modules, which are the same ones used in this project. Since this project itself is very limited in scope, it may also
be easier to simply clone this repository in full and not have to install the modules manually.
